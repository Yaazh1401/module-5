# EX â€“ 30 -STRUCURE

## AIM

Write a C program to create a student structure having fields stud_name and address. Accept the details of 'n' students, rearrange the data in alphabetical order of student name and display it.

## ALGORITHM 
Start

Define a structure Student with:

stud_name (string)

address (string)

Declare an array students[MAX_STUDENTS] to store student data

Read the number of students n

For each student from 0 to n - 1:

Read stud_name

Read address

Call the function sortStudents(students, n):

For i from 0 to n - 2:

For j from i + 1 to n - 1:

If students[i].stud_name comes after students[j].stud_name alphabetically (using strcmp):

Swap students[i] and students[j] using a temporary variable

After sorting, print the list:

For each student from 0 to n - 1:

Print stud_name and address

End



## PROGRAM
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#define MAX_STUDENTS 50
#define MAX_LENGTH 50
struct Student {
    char stud_name[MAX_LENGTH];
    char address[MAX_LENGTH];
};
void sortStudents(struct Student students[], int n) {
    struct Student temp;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (strcmp(students[i].stud_name, students[j].stud_name) > 0) {
                temp = students[i];
                students[i] = students[j];
                students[j] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
int main() {
    struct Student students[MAX_STUDENTS];
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%s", students[i].stud_name);
        scanf("%s", students[i].address);
    }
    sortStudents(students, n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%s      %s\n", students[i].stud_name, students[i].address);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
